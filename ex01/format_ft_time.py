        For use time : import time as t
        t.time(): Current timestamp (seconds since epoch)
        t.sleep(seconds): Pause execution for a given duration
        t.strftime(format, time_struct): Format time

2- The datetime module in Python provides classes
    for manipulating dates and times in both simple and
    complex ways. It allows you to work with dates,
    times, time intervals, and even time zones.
